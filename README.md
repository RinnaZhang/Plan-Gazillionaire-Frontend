# PoliBets

Your gateway to smart betting and arbitrage opportunities.

## Description
PoliBets is a web application designed to help users explore and track smart betting strategies and arbitrage opportunities. With a focus on data-driven insights, the app enables users to maximize their betting potential through a user-friendly and organized interface. The app provides categories, timeframes, and profitability thresholds to refine search results, offering detailed insights into various events, including elections, economic summits, etc.

**Important Note**: Currently, when you click on the "See details" button, you need to scroll down slightly to the end of our opportunities list to see details. We are still working on fixing this and will provide an update here once everything is perfectly aligned...
